Specifically, it displays the number of innovations in fossil fuel and renewable energy innovations, as well as their share in total energy innovations, for each country over the period 2000-2017. It uses a color scheme to allow for a global comparison of countries for each year and each measure. Additionally, users can conveniently look at the country-specific innovation trend for each type of measures by clicking on the country.
